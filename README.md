## Tech

PiDrobe uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Java](https://www.java.com/) - A general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented.
* [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) - It is a capable little computer which can be used in electronics projects, and for many of the things that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, word processing, browsing the internet, and playing games.
